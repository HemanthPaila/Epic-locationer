<h3 align="center"><i>Small story to start this ...</i></h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a group of avid travelers who loved to explore new places and share their experiences with others. They often found themselves searching for information about destinations online, but they were frustrated by the lack of reliable and comprehensive resources available. One day, a young man named Alex had an idea. He decided to create a platform where travelers could share their experiences, posts, and tips with one another. Alex imagined a platform where users could discuss everything from how much money they needed for a trip to what to pack and where to eat. Alex got to work, building the platform from scratch. He spent months perfecting the design and functionality, making sure it was easy to use and accessible to everyone. Finally, the platform was ready, and Alex invited his friends to join. Soon, more and more travelers began to join the platform. They shared their experiences, posted pictures and videos, and offered valuable advice to others planning trips. The platform became a hub of information, and people from all over the world began to use it to plan their travels. One day, a young woman named Sarah stumbled upon the platform while planning her first solo trip. She was nervous and unsure about what to expect, but the platform gave her the confidence she needed to take the leap. She read posts from other solo travelers and got tips on what to pack and how to stay safe. When Sarah returned from her trip, she posted about her experiences on the platform. She shared photos and stories, and thanked the other users for their advice. Her post inspired other travelers to visit the same destination, and soon, it became a popular spot for the platform's users. As the platform grew in popularity, Alex realized that he had created something special. He had given travelers a space to connect, share their stories, and learn from one another. The platform had become a community, and Alex was proud to have brought it to life. In the end, the platform continued to thrive, helping travelers from all over the world plan their trips and create unforgettable memories.</p>
<h3 align="center">Problem Statement?</h3>
<p>If you're still unsure about the problem statement after reading the above story, allow me to clarify it for you.
Imagine a platform where seasoned travelers share their experiences, tips, and advice for others interested in visiting the same destinations. This platform provides valuable information about everything from what to pack to where to eat, making it an indispensable resource for anyone planning a trip. Whether you're an experienced traveler or someone who's never left their hometown, this platform is the perfect place to learn, connect, and discover new places.

<h3 align="center">Solution!</h3>
<p>To tackle the above problem effectively, we propose the development of a simple and straightforward website that provides a solution.
From a technical standpoint, the website comprises both frontend and backend components. To develop the frontend, we utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React framework. Meanwhile, the backend was developed using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB serving as the database.To ensure the successful completion of this website, I am adhering to the Agile methodology, which involves a continuous iterative process from planning to deployment.</p>
<h3 align="center">Agile Methodology</h3>
<p>Agile software development is divided into several phases that follow an iterative and incremental approach. The following are the typical phases in agile development:</p>
<li>Planning: This phase involves defining the project scope, identifying the stakeholders, and creating a roadmap for the project. The team also identifies the high-level requirements and user stories to be developed in the upcoming sprints.</li>
<li>Design: In this phase, the team creates detailed designs for each user story, including wireframes, user interface (UI) designs, and database schemas. The team may also create technical specifications and test plans for each story.</li>
<li>Development: This phase involves coding the software, implementing the designs, and creating unit tests to verify the code. The development is typically divided into sprints, with each sprint lasting one to four weeks.</li>
<li>Testing: In this phase, the team tests the software to ensure that it meets the acceptance criteria for each user story. The team may perform manual testing, automated testing, or a combination of both.</li>
<li>Deployment: Once the software has been tested and approved, it is deployed to a production environment. The team may use continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools to automate the deployment process.</li>
<h3 align="center">Planning Phase</h3>
<p>In the planning phase of Agile methodology, the project team comes together to establish project goals and objectives, define requirements, and identify tasks and deliverables. The team also determines the project timeline, assigns tasks to team members, and establishes project milestones. Throughout this phase, the team works closely with stakeholders to ensure that their needs are met and that the project is aligned with their expectations. The planning phase sets the foundation for the rest of the project, and it is critical to its success.</p>
<li>Our primary objective for this project is to deliver functional software that effectively solves the problem statement we have identified. We are committed to developing a solution that meets the needs and expectations of our users and provides value to them.</li>
